# Structural-Bioinformatics
I will try to upload all the assignments I have done during my masters in structural bioinformatics course. Assignment1 explains about the short function to compute **dihedral angle** for any given four vectors. And goes into little deep, caculate the  dihedral angle (**both phi and psi**) for a given **protein in PDB/mmCIF** file format. Then plotting a **Ramchandran plot out of all phi/psi angles** computed. One can depicts the **α-helix, β-sheets and γ-turns** from the plot.
